FamFin makes envelope budgeting simple, powerful, and delightful. Whether you're managing money as a couple, budgeting for a growing family, or taking control of your own finances, FamFin gives you the tools to spend intentionally, save consistently, and reach your financial goals.

ENVELOPE BUDGETING MADE SIMPLE
Give every pound, dollar, or euro a job. FamFin uses the proven envelope budgeting method to help you allocate income into spending categories before you spend. Assign money to Groceries, Rent, Entertainment, and more. When an envelope is empty, you know to stop spending. It is the most effective way to stay on track.

TRACK EVERY TRANSACTION
Log expenses and income quickly with smart auto-categorisation. Import transactions from your bank using CSV or OFX files, or add them manually. FamFin learns your payees and suggests categories automatically, saving you time with every entry.

SAVINGS GOALS WITH VISUAL PROGRESS
Set savings goals for holidays, emergency funds, new purchases, or anything that matters to you. Watch your progress with beautiful ring charts, hit milestones at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, and celebrate each achievement with confetti. Link goals to budget categories for seamless tracking.

RECURRING TRANSACTIONS
Set up repeating bills and income so you never forget a payment. FamFin automatically generates transactions on schedule, keeping your budget accurate without manual effort.

POWERFUL REPORTS AND INSIGHTS
Understand where your money goes with interactive charts. View spending breakdowns by category, compare income versus expenses, track trends over time, and identify your top spending areas. Customise your dashboard with the charts that matter most to you.

MULTI-CURRENCY SUPPORT
Budget in the currency that works for you. FamFin supports pounds, dollars, euros, and more, adapting to your locale and preference.

FAMILY SHARING AND COLLABORATION
Share your budget with a partner or family member through iCloud sharing. See real-time activity feeds showing who added transactions, updated budgets, or contributed to goals. Budget together as a team.
